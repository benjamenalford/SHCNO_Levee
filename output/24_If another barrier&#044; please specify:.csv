Didn't know about it,1
Didn't know about them until now.,1

Feeling safe,1
Gravel gets mushy when wet.,1
I didn't know it was allowed and in general I don't tresspass.,1
I didn’t know the levee trails existed. Where are the access points?,1
I didn’t realize that the levee was open for use.,1
I won't go on small trails like the Shunga. I'm looking for lower traffic trails.,0
I'll spend leisure time (if any) on 12th Street. It could be a fun game dodging the rocks and bottles hurled at bike riders by residents of the adjoining property that had this jammed down their throats by special interests.,0
I'm under the assumption a great 'social experiment' is underway to discourage vehicle traffic and encourage bike traffic on 12th Street. Since millions of dollars will be spent to reinforce this initiative,1
Is it even legal to use?,1
Knowing where acceptable access points are,1
Lack of connectivity,1
Lack of convenient access points.,1
No idea where to access it from.,1

Trail surface - broken glass and not currently maintained (last time I tried to ride was 2017).,1
Uninformed on where they’re actually at.,1
but I will check it out and see how good it is. I was actually looking for a gravel trail last weekend b/c the dirt trails have been so sloppy so I may check this out this weekend. I marked Covid. Until we are through this,0
gravel is to hard for handicapped citizens to safely and easily manuver,1
i did not know they are open to use,1
surface quality.   Large ballast is a negitive.,1
we have to climb and/or lift bicycles over,0
