Clearly marked parking and access for these trails would make a difference. Also,1
Connection to The Shunga and Soldier levee system.,1
GA.  They have a nice river walk area.,0
I am a land owner on the river between Silver Lake &amp; Topeka. The levees at least on the north side of the river between Rossville &amp; Topeka are on private property &amp; the levees themselves are property of the drainage district.  Trespassing causes a lot of issues for us landowners.,1
I am new to Topeka (moved 1 year ago). I didn't know this. It needs to be added to the Shawnee County Trail Guide https://parks.snco.us/DocumentCenter/View/1571/Trail-Guide-Website?bidId=  and the parks Trail website https://parks.snco.us/92/Trails-Maps . You also should work with https://www.getoutdoorskansas.org/ to get it added to that site so that people know about the trails.,1
I had no idea this was a thing! Just more advertising that it is available would help,1
I think hosting more 5K,1
I truly had no idea the levee was a public right-of-way,1
I would love to see kayak access  ramps to the river!,1
I would use all the sections and more if available.,1
I've lived in Topeka for almost 20 years and I did not know you could do this. When I lived in Lawrence I rode the Levey system there. Thanks for tweeting about this today.,1
It seems as if much of the levee in Shawnee County looks unaccessible even if it isn't. The area between Kansas and 75 are hidden behind businesses and industrial companies,1
Look at Augusta,1
Maple Hill,0
Missouri or New Orleans for walking,0
Not familiar with the area hence unsure of trail condition,1
Organize Friends or the levee to promote events,1
Please get the homeless away from trails.,1
Please look into the Oakland levee as well.,1
Silver Lake,0
So glad you all are working on this,1
Used to live in Albuquerque where the levee trail is a major feature. Would be nice to have that in Topeka.,1
Ways to access these trails from communities like Rossville,1
We need maps.  Levy trails run across railroad tracks and it's not clear what is legal.  And some levies run only a mile or two before cutting off,1

access that looks like the access points of other trails would help. Industrial looking,0
and biking.,0
and there is plenty of signage that seems to indicate otherwise.,0
connections,0
cyclists in these communities to have a trail to link us to Topeka and it's other trails.,0
etc would be awesome. There's not many low traffic gravel type paths that connect these communities to Topeka. Would be awesome for runners,0
hikers,0
hiking,0
it would be such a boost to Topeka's amenities to enhance this resource! Thanks!,0
it's difficult to know what routes are helpful.,0
maintain area etc,0
or access that doesn't clearly communicate that the trail is open to the public  can discourage use. Thanks for this effort!,0
or half marathon races would help people realize these paths are available.  I know with COVID itâ€™s hard to do right but even having a virtual race with a predetermined route would help get people involved.,0
safety.,0
test,1
the rural areas have little vehicle access and are behind private property. Not to mention the potential crime which would require extra lighting and security to deter. I would love a heavily used levee like in Lawrence,0
